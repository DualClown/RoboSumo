# RoboSumo
RoboSumo made in C, with the CCS C compiller and microcontroller PIC16F877A.

## Circuit
For creating a PCB suited for our application we started by making a list of the materials that we need just for the PCB.

So for the first step of desingning your own PCB you have to be very carefull because if you mess up any conection the whole PCB won't work and all the money you spent on it will be lost. The circuit was made using [Proteus Design Suite](https://www.labcenter.com/), we make sure to keep things very small but because we are using 40-pin PDIP the PCB get a little bit big beacuse of that, neither the motor driver or the boost converter are big so most of the space is the microcontroller
